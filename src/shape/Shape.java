/**
 * The Shape class is an abstract representation of a 3D shape.
 * 
 * This class provides the foundational structure for any 3D shape, 
 * capturing common properties like height and defining abstract methods 
 * for volume and base area, which must be implemented by any concrete subclass.
 * 
 * The class also implements the Comparable interface, allowing shapes to be 
 * compared based on their volume and, if volumes are equal, their height.
